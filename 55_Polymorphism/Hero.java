//PolyMorphism 
//Many Behaviour

//Polymorphism is the ability of a single function or method to operate on multiple data types. 
//Polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'.
//Polymorphism can be static or dynamic.
//Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding.


//compile time polymorphism (method overloading)
//Run time polymorphism (method overriding)
