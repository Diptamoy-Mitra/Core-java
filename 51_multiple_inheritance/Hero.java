// Multiple inheritance

//A (parent) <-- C (child)
//B (parent) <-- C (child) 

// A class has show(), y()
//B class has x(), y()
//C class creates object and inherites both A,B
//Now obj.show() its work
//obj.x() its work
//obj.y() its not work, C gets confuse whats class's function will choose.

// its not work because its faces ambiguity.
